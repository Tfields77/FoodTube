pL8rFULiDn0,Bucketlist Speakeasy Bars in NYC: part 3,"🤫Bucketlist Speakeasy Bars in NYC: part 3🍸
 
🏦Named after one of the felonious private bankers, this speakeasy mixology bar is located on the second floor of a burger joint and still accessed through a bank vault door to remind the guests of this building’s exciting history: the location was run as a corrupt bank in the 1920s.

⚜️Vintage vibe, cozy feel, velvet furnishings & crafted unique cocktails – all what makes this place perfect for a pre-dinner gathering, chill outing with friends or date night.

🔝Service is superb, and the bartenders can get creative if you can’t find a cocktail that fits your vibe for the night (most cocktails are inspired by Prohibition Era).

📆Unlike some other speakeasies, they do accept reservations so make one ahead of time as given it’s a pretty small place, it gets full quickly especially on the weekends.
